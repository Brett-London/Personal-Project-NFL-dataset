- In this project, I analyzed and visualized team statistics from the 2022-2023 NFL Regular Season using Tableau. The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of team performances through insightful visualizations.

- 🧠 Data Source:
The data was meticulously pulled from datasets available on Kaggle. 

- 📈 Visualizations Overview:
The visualizations showcase general statistics from the 2022-2023 NFL Regular Season, highlighting key metrics such as total points scored, average yards per game, and defensive rankings. These visuals are designed to make it easy to compare team performances at a glance.

- 📃 Calculated Fields:
To enhance the analysis, I created calculated fields that allow for the assessment of averages within various statistics. This approach helps in identifying trends and understanding how teams stack up against one another in critical areas.

- 📊 Game Classification:
I utilized IF/ElseIF functions to categorize games into low, average, and high-scoring brackets. This classification aids in quickly identifying game patterns and can be valuable for both fans and analysts looking to interpret team strengths and weaknesses.

Overall, this project not only sharpened my data visualization skills but also deepened my understanding of sports analytics and its practical applications.
